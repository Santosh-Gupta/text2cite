Upcoming project using Bert to analyze citation networks in research papers. 

This is a project we're doing for Tensorflow's https://tfworld.devpost.com/ hackathon. 

We'll be working with Huggingface's new TF Bert models, and will be somewhat of a sequel to my old research2vec project here https://github.com/Santosh-Gupta/Research2Vec

We're hoping to release models and demo by the middle of december.
